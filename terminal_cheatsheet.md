## The different Terminal Commands:

| Command | What it does |
| ------ | ----- |
| ```rm```| remove files or folders |
| ``` mkdir ``` | make directory. i.e. a new folder |
| ``` cd ``` | change directory ```cd ..``` will take you back one folder. |

### Other commands:
- ```mv``` : move file/folder
- ```ls``` : list files in a directory
- ```ls -a``` : list all files in a directory **including dot(.) files**
- ```pwd``` : Print Working Directory. It shows you which directory you are currently in.
